## Project Overview

The bank account system showcases different types of accounts (SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount) and their functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing, and calculating interest. It employs various design patterns to manage different aspects of the accounts.

## Design Patterns Used

- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for implementing different account types (SavingsAccountType and CurrentAccountType) with varying interest calculation strategies.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of the Bank class exists throughout the application.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Allows additional functionalities to be added to accounts dynamically.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Adapts the legacy account operations to fit the Account interface.
- **Observer Pattern**: Notifies observers about changes in account balances.
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates instances of different account types using respective factories.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Java files:
- `Bank.java`: Implements the Singleton pattern for the bank entity.
- `Account.java`: Defines the Account interface.
- `SavingsAccount.java` and `CurrentAccount.java`: Implement different account functionalities.
- `LegacyAccount.java` and `LegacyAccountAdapter.java`: Demonstrate the Adapter pattern.
- `AccountObserver.java`: Implements the Observer pattern.
- `AccountFactory.java`, `SavingsAccountFactory.java`, and `CurrentAccountFactory.java`: Showcases the Factory pattern.
- `BankAccountDemo.java`: Contains the main method to run the application.

## How to Run

To run the project:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile all the Java files using `javac *.java`.
3. Run the application using `java BankAccountDemo`.
